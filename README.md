# Autonomous_Grid_Agent
The program implements a Grid Environment where a start state and goal state are defined. Obstacles are represented in the grid, and the task is to find a valid route from the start to the goal. The project integrates multiple classical search algorithms, making it useful for studying and comparing their performance.
